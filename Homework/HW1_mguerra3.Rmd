## Question 1 [10 Points] Importing and merging datasets

In this homework, we'll use data from Chicago-IL communities. The source is the [GeoDa Data and Lab](https://geodacenter.github.io/data-and-lab/). The first dataset [Airbnb](https://github.com/guerramarcelino/UrbanEconomics/raw/master/Datasets/airbnb.RDS) refers to Airbnb rentals, socioeconomic indicators, and crime by community area in Chicago. The [Communities](https://github.com/guerramarcelino/UrbanEconomics/raw/master/Datasets/communities.xls) dataset contains health and socioeconomic indicators for the 77 community areas of Chicago, 2012-2014. You can find more information about the `Airbnb` and `Communities` data [here](https://geodacenter.github.io/data-and-lab//airbnb_Chicago-2015/) and [here](https://geodacenter.github.io/data-and-lab//comarea_vars/), respectively.

a. [5 points] Import both datasets and use the function `head()` **to see only the first three rows** from each one. [This](https://readxl.tidyverse.org/) might help you to import the `Communities` data.   

b. [5 points]  Merge the datasets using the function `full_join()`. What is the dimension of your new dataset? What variables do they have in common (variables with the same column name)?  


## Question 2 [50 Points] Subsetting/Filtering data & new variables

a. [5 points] Now you want to work only with the following variables: `community`, `price_pp`, `num_spots`, `rev_rating`, `PerCInc14` , `population`, `num_crimes` ,`unemployed`, `hardship_in`, `Pop2014`, `Birthrate`, `Over65`. Create a new `data.frame` selecting those variables.

b. [5 points] Create the new variable `crime_rate` dividing the total number of crimes by the **population in 2014**.

c. [15 points] Filter your new dataset to identify **Central Chicago**. In other words, you want to select the following communities: `NEAR NORTH SIDE`, `NEAR SOUTH SIDE`, or `LOOP`. What is the average number of Airbnb spots in Central Chicago? What are the average Airbnb prices, per capita income, crime rate, and birth rate in Central Chicago?

d. [15 points] Compare those numbers (Airbnb spots and prices, income, crime, and birth rate) in Central Chicago with the values from Central Chicago adjacent communities - communities that share a border with Central Chicago. Discuss the results.  

e. [10 points] Finally, compare the values for the same variables in Central Chicago with the average numbers from "Far from downtown" - the communities with numbers equal to 1, 2, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 51, 52, 54, 55. Discuss the results.

## Question 3 [30 Points] Scatter plots

a. [15 points] Let's take a look at the relationship between **crime rate** and Airbnb prices. Construct a scatter plot between those variables (y-axis Airbnb prices and x-axis crime rate). What do you see? What might other variables in your dataset be correlated with the crime rate and possibly impact Airbnb prices? 


In [lab session 2](https://guerramarcelino.github.io/Econ414/lab2) we saw the strong and positive relationship between the share of the population living in urban areas (%) and the GDP per capita (U$ 2011) for 164 selected countries. Now, we want to establish a relationship between employment in the rural sector and the urban population.

b. [15 points] Construct a scatter plot to show the relationship between urbanization and employment in the rural sector using information from Our World in Data [(here)](https://github.com/guerramarcelino/UrbanEconomics/raw/master/Datasets/agri_urban.xls), in 2015. **Explore the potential channels between jobs in agriculture, urbanization, and GDP per capita**. [Here](https://ourworldindata.org/structural-transformation-and-deindustrialization-evidence-from-todays-rich-countries), you find a pleasant reading that might help you make your case.    



## Question 4 [25 Points] Working with tidycensus

a. [10 points] To get started with `tidycensus`, you need to install the package and set a Census API key. Use this link [(here)](https://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html) to request a key. You can use "University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign" as an organization and your student account as an email address. After that, use `census_api_key("your_api_number_goes_here", install =TRUE)` and you are set. Get and load your API number. Then, check the variables for the American Community Survey 3-year estimates for 2010 (load the variables and use `head()` to see the frist 5 variables).          


b. [15 extra points] Calculate the median gross rent growth per state between 1990 and 2010 using Census data. Arrange your data so we can see which ones had the highest growth and decline in median rent between that period. [Here](https://walker-data.com/tidycensus/articles/basic-usage.html) and [here](https://dcl-wrangle.stanford.edu/census.html) you can find more about the `tidycensus` package.
